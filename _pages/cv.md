I am currently a lecturer in the School of Computer Science, Xiangtan University (XTU), P. R. China. Prior to joining XTU, I received my Ph.D. degree in School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering from Hunan University in June 2021. Since October 2019 till August 2020, I was a visiting scholar at Univesity of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), under the supervison of Prof. Philip S. Yu. My research interests include machine learning and graph neural networks for bioinformatics. I have published more than 10 technical papers in refereed conference proceedings such as AAAI, IJCAI, ECAI, and BIBM, and journals such as IEEE TKDE, TCBB, WIREs Computational Molecular Science and Briefings in Bioinformatics.
