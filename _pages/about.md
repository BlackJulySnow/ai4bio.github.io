Our laboratory focuses on cutting-edge research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and computational biology. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to enhance predictive capabilities in the following key areas:

* Molecular Property Prediction: Utilizing AI to predict chemical and physical properties of molecules, advancing drug discovery and development.
* Compound-Protein Interaction Prediction: Investigating how small molecules interact with proteins to facilitate targeted therapy design.
* Drug-Target Binding Affinity Prediction: Predicting the strength of binding between drug candidates and their biological targets, aiding in precision medicine.
* Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction: Using machine learning to predict adverse interactions between medications, improving patient safety.
By integrating AI-driven methodologies with biological and chemical data, our research aims to accelerate the development of novel therapeutics and improve healthcare outcomes.
